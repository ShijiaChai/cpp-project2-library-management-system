# cpp-project2-library-management-system
A big project by using C++ ,buliding a library management system

By studying courses like Computer Programming Design 1 and 2, and then completing the project assignment. I excellently completed the corresponding requirements of the program design. I applied OOP principles well and completed the programming task in the programming process. In the project, I used Abstraction,Encapsulation,  Polymorphism, and Inheritancezhe to complete the programming, including the student score management system and library management system these two programs. In the process of design, I established a clear class hierarchy for the designed program; The number of classes designed in each program is not less than 4, and each class has its own rich and diverse attributes (more than 3) and methods (more than three functions); I defined an abstract class and then derived other classes by inheritance. And the derived class of multiple inheritances is successfully designed. The mechanism of function polymorphism and operator overloading is introduced in program design. Besides, I design the test data, store the test data in the file, and conduct the data read and write test through the file.
